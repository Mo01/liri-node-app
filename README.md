# liri-node-app

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. LIRI wll also have the ability to read a .txt file and run whatever command is written there.
